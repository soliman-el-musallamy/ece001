</li>
            <li>It must be interpreted, threaded, and dynamic.</li>


        </ol>

WHAT MAKES LEARNING IT IMPORTANT?
C Language is used to develop systems applications that are integrated into operating systems such as Windows, UNIX and Linux, as well as embedded softwares. Applications include graphics packages, word processors, spreadsheets, operating system development, database systems, compilers and assemblers, network drivers and interpreters.
        <ol>
            <li>Facebook’s TAO systems is programmed mostly using C language.
</li>
            <li>Most device drivers are still developed using C Language.</li>
            


        </ol>

Features:
        <ol>
            <li>Simple to learn; there are only 32 keywords to master</li>
            <li>Easy to write systems programs such as compilers and interpreters</li>
            <li>Foundational language for beginners </li>
            


        </ol>



WHERE DID IT START?
The C Language was developed in 1972 at Bell Labs specifically for implementing the UNIX system. It eventually gave rise to many advanced programming languages, including C++, Java C#, JavaScript and Pearl.</p>
